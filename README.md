# elm-in-redux

## Motivation

* write bulletproof businesslogic
* keep the react (and redux) ecosystem
* don't have to commit 100% to it

## Running the Example

the examples use directly the src folder so first of all :
```bash
npm install
```
then :
```bash
cd examples/theExampleYouWant
npm install
npm start
```
* open [localhost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
